# Digital Logic Design (DLD) Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains simulations and experiments related to Digital Logic Design (DLD). These experiments help understand fundamental digital circuits and their behavior using simulation tools like Logisim, Quartus, or Verilog.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1
- Basic logic gates and their truth tables.

### Experiment 2
- Implementation of Boolean expressions using logic gates.

### Experiment 3
- Design and simulation of combinational circuits.

### Experiment 6: Adders & Subtractors
- **Half Adder** – Adds two binary digits and outputs sum and carry.
- **Full Adder** – Adds three binary digits (two inputs + carry-in) and outputs sum and carry.
- **Half Subtractor** – Computes the difference between two binary digits and outputs difference and borrow.
- **Full Subtractor** – Computes the difference of three binary digits (two inputs + borrow-in) and outputs difference and borrow.

### Experiment 7: Advanced Circuits
- **4-bit Full Adder** – A cascade of full adders to perform addition on 4-bit binary numbers.
- **BCD Converter** – Converts binary numbers to Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) format.
- **Comparator** – Compares two binary numbers and determines equality, greater than, or less than conditions.
- **Parity Checker** – Checks for even or odd parity in a given binary sequence.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DLD-Simulation.git
   ```
2. Open the relevant simulation files in your preferred tool (e.g., Logisim, Quartus, Verilog, etc.).
3. Run the simulations and analyze circuit behavior.
